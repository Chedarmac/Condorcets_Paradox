# Condorcet Paradox Game ðŸŽ²

 Overview
This game is inspired by **Condorcet's Paradox**, a concept in social choice theory that demonstrates how collective preferences can be cyclic, even if individual preferences are not. This paradox highlights the challenges in determining a clear "winner" in a voting system.

Players will explore the paradox by making decisions, voting, or strategizing in a simulated scenario that showcases these cyclical preferences.

This is a game based on the non-transitiivty of voting choices.
